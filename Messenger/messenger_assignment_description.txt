You are to create a direct messenger program. In particular, the program will perform as follows:

    It must behave as either a client or a server, depending on the command line arguments supplied when started.
    Specifically, the -l option will direct the program to listen for connections, thereby acting as a server. If the -l option is not present on the command line, your program will connect to a server, thereby acting as a client.
    The port number must also be supplied as a command line argument.
    Although your messenger may be hard-coded to connect only to localhost when acting as a client, you may include a server address on the command line as well, thereby permitting your messenger to connect between hosts.
    The -l option, if used, should be placed immediately after the name of the program and before the port number and server address arguments.
    Once the client and server messengers are connected, either end can send text messages to the other end.
    Messages must be provided to the program using standard input.
    Immediately after receiving a message, the program must output the message to standard output.
    A messenger program must begin the termination process as soon as either of the following conditions occur:
        standard input has been closed by the program's user
        the program receives a socket message from the other messenger that it is shutting down
    If a messenger is terminating because standard input has closed, the program must first shut down sending, then close the socket. Once one end shuts down, the other messenger will receive a zero-length message, i.e., a packet header with no payload, informing it of the shut down. The other side must then terminate immediately.

Usage

    Usage as a server:
        Python:

        $> python messenger.py -l <port number>

        Java:

        $> java Messenger -l <port number>

    Usage as a client:
        Python:

        $> python messenger.py <port number> [<server address>]

        Java:

        $> java Messenger <port number> [<server address>]
